title: "Arda AkgÃ¼l"
description: "I was born and grew up in Ankara, TÃ¼rkiye. I am currently a college student at TED University, studying Economical and Administrative Science's first grade. As it is liberal arts, economics, business administration, and politics are taught in the first year then the major is chosen in second grade.

Relatively, I have been interested in politics, history, and economics since the very beginning of high school. This led me to choose this career way. I wrote an article about European Union and TÃ¼rkiye relations.  

Also, I like being a participant in volunteering organizations, so I am a member of AIESEC and a fundamental volunteer of AFAD (Ministry of Interior, Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency). At AIESEC, I am dealing with projects selling and negotiating with people who want to participate in AIESEC projects abroad.

I expand my knowledge and skills in the fields of economics, politics, international relations, and areas I am interested in. I am trying to learn from experienced professionals and contribute to the development of myself, my country, and the world. I believe that I am trying my academic background, personal interests, and volunteer experience to make me a suitable candidate for opportunities and projects related to these areas. I hope to connect with like-minded people on Linkedin."
